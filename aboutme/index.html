  <h2>Katt</h2>
  <p>Hello everyone! This is my second semester at BYU-I. It has been really hard for me to get used to everything and especially to be far away from my family. I'm from Ecuador, and I am the oldest of seven siblings.</p> 
  <p>I got baptized when I was 18 years old and a year later my parents became members of the church as well. I served a mission in Peru, Lima North.</p>
  <p>I currently don't have a very clear idea of what I would really like to choose as a major yet. However, I am excited to take this course because I love to be practical and learn at the same time, and I believe this course offers this expectation. Something I love about this course as well is that is very useful in real life. My hope this semester is to learn more.</p>
  <p> My favorite scripture is Fil 4:8, "Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable-if anything is excellent or praiseworthy-think about such things."</p>
  <p>I love learning new things. I love anything related with Science, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Languages.</p>
  <p>Thank you for looking at my web page.</p>
